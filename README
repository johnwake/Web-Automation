Welcome, 

I have a simple web application example for you to explian how Cucumber works in a BDD way, Using Cucumber, Capybara, Sinatra and Ruby. 

To Get Started you need to install the following Ruby Gems using bundler.

$ bundle install

One this is installed you free to run your this Cucumber test. You can do this my typing 
$ cucumber

All Tests should pass and give you a nice green output. 

You can also just run the web application without using the tests by using: 

$ shotgun

and then going to http://localhost:9393 from a browser.
